# Chapter 5 -- Biological molecules

## Proteins (5.1 & 5.4)

For this reading guide, please read 5.1 and 5.4 (proteins) *before* your lab date. You can do the other sections after.

> OBJECTIVE: Describe the formation and breakdown of polymers by dehydration and hydrolysis reactions.

1. A \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is a long molecule made up of subunits called \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. They are assembled in a chemical reaction called \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and disassembled in a chemical reaction called \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
2. Look at Fig 5.2a.  Why do you think this is called a dehydration reaction?{{site.space3}}

    > OBJECTIVE: Describe the structure and function of amino acids and proteins.

3. Proteins are made from smaller molecules (building blocks) called ...{{site.space0}}
4. Study the diagram at the bottom of page 75. This is the general form for ALL amino acids. How many covalent bonds does the alpha carbon of an amino acid form? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Why?{{site.space3}}
5. Look at the general structure/formula of an amino acid (pg. 75). Overall, are amino acids hydrophobic or hydrophilic? Explain why.{{site.space3}}
6. Draw the general structure of an amino acid in non-ionized (p 75) AND ionized forms (Fig 5.14) and label the alpha carbon. {{site.space4}}
7. In the structure above, circle and label the two functional groups present in every amino acid (which is why they are called amino acids!).
8. What would the carboxyl group look like if it came into contact with a base? Remember that a base absorbs H+ ions from the solution.{{site.space3}}
9. In Figure 5.14, the amino acids are shown in their ionic forms at pH ~7. Using glycine as an example, show how the general structure of an amino acid would be different at an extremely acidic pH? A very basic pH? Explain.

    | Glycine @ pH2 | Glycine @ pH7 | Glycine @ pH13 |
    |-|-|-|
    |<textarea cols="25%" rows="10" style="border-width: 0px;"></textarea>   | <textarea cols="25%" rows="10" style="border-width: 0px;"></textarea>   | <textarea cols="25%" rows="10" style="border-width: 0px;"></textarea>   |

    > OBJECTIVE: Be able to identify amino acids as hydrophilic or hydrophobic and whether they have polar, nonpolar, or electrically charged side chains. You do NOT need to memorize all amino acids, but you should be able to identify properties if given the structure of an amino acid.
