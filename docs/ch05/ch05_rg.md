# Chapter 5 -- Carbohydrates

> OBJECTIVE: Describe the structure and function of carbohydrate monomers and polymers

1. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ are the monomers of complex carbohydrates.
2. Look at Figures 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3. What do all the molecules have in common so they are considered to be in the category of carbohydrates.{{site.space3}}
3. Most names for sugars end in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
4. Complete this table. You will have to figure out the formula for ribose, which you should be able to do if you know that it is a pentose.

    | Monosaccharide | # Carbon atoms | Molecular formaula |
    |----------------|----------------|--------------------|
    | Ribose         |                |                    |
    | Glucose        |                |                    |

5. What is the difference between ketoses and aldoses? How does this affect the molecular formula?{{site.space3}}
6. What happens to most 5 and 6 carbon sugars in aqueous solutions? Why is this reaction shown as an equilibrium reaction?{{site.space3}}
7. Draw 2 glucose monomers side by side. Connect them with a 1-4 glycosidic linkage.{{site.space5}}
8. What is the difference between &alpha; and &beta; glucose?{{site.space3}}
9. What is the shape of a long, unbranched, polymer made of &alpha;-glucose?{{site.space3}}
10. What is the shape of a long, unbranched, polymer made of &beta;-glucose?{{site.space3}}
11. Why does &beta;-glucose form structural polymers, whereas &alpha;-glucose would never be suitable for that?{{site.space3}}
12. Knowing that chitin is used in the exoskeleton of insects, what can you infer about the type of glucose and glycosidic bond used in building it?{{site.space3}}

# Do the following in or after class...

    > OBJECTIVE: Understand why carbohydrates are good molecules for energy storage.

1. Draw a large diagram of a molecule of &alpha;-glucose in cyclic form. Make sure to include all H and O atoms. For each bond, show the location of the shared electrons. Make sure that their position is commensurate with the relative electronegativity of the atoms. {{site.space5}}
1. When we metabolize glucose, we produce CO<sub>2</sub>. Draw a diagram of this molecule, showing the relative positions of the shared electrons.{{site.space3}}
1. Why do you think glucose is good for storing energy?{{site.space3}}
1. Use the modeling kits to make construct 2 molecules of &alpha;-glucose. Then, combine them with a glycosidic bond. Then, remake one molecule into &beta;-glucose and combine it with an &alpha;-glucose with a &beta;-glycosidic bond.
