# Chapter 5 -- Biological macromolecules

This chapter introduces 4 important classes of macromolecules. We will revisit some of them later as we talk about biological systems or processes for which they are important.
* Proteins
* Carbohydrates
* Lipids
* Nucleic Acids

To complete the work for this chapter you should:
- [x] Download and print the [reading guide](ch05_rg.html) if you don't already have a hard copy.
- [x] Read chapter 5 in Campbell.
- [x] Watch video on Proteins (this should be the first you watch, despite the order in the textbook)

- [x] Watch video on Nucleic acids

Some of the information in the videos exceeds that presented in Campbell, and there is some content that you do not need for exams. In particular:
* You do not need to know the structures of all amino acids. Be able to recognize whether an amino acid is likely to be hydrophobic or hydrophilic and acid, neutral, or basic based on its structure. You will be presented with the structure for any you need to evaluate.
* You do not need to know details about naming carbohydrates. You should recognize the ways in which they differ.
