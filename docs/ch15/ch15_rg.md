# Chapter 15 -- Chromosomal theory of inheritance

> OBJECTIVE: Understand that genes are located on chromosomes and the chromosomal basis of Mendel's laws
  
1. Look at Fig 15.2. What is Mendel's first law? How does it relate to our chromosomes?{{site.space5}}
2. What is Mendel's 2nd law? How does it relate to the arrangement of chromosomes during meiosis?{{site.space5}}

    > OBJECTIVE: Recognize the patterns of inheritance associated with sex-linked genes

3. Draw the results shown in Fig 15.4 as a pedigree:
    * Show the mating of a wild-type female with a white-eyed male. Use the correct symbols in your pedigree.
    * Show an F<sub>1</sub> generation with a single male and a single female.
    * Show the full-sib mating of the F<sub>1</sub>s by connecting them with 2 parallel, horizontal lines (geneticists use two horizontal lines to show inbreeding).
    * Show the 4 types of offspring in the F<sub>2</sub>
    * Label each individual with their genotype. Use the symbols *w*, *w<sup>+</sup>*, and *Y* to show the Y chromosome which does not contain the gene for eye color. {{site.space9}}
4. Using a different cross, would it be possible to have a white-eyed female? What cross would produce:
    * half white-eyed females{% if site.data.answers.rg15 %}<span class="ans"> w<sup>+</sup>w	&#9792; &times; wY 	&#9794;     </span>{% else %}{{site.space3}}{% endif %}
    * all white-eyed females (all males would also be white-eyed){% if site.data.answers.rg15 %}<span class="ans">  ww &#9792; &times; wY 	&#9794;    </span>{% else %}{{site.space1}}{% endif %}
5. At what stage of meiosis does the X chromosome separate from the Y?{{site.space0}}
6. Hemophilia in humans is X-linked, recessive. Show the four genotypes of children possible from a normal female whose father was hemophilic and a hemophilic man. Use X<sup>H</sup> and X<sup>h</sup> for the dominant and recessive alleles, respectively.{% if site.data.answers.rg15 %}<span class="ans">Showing the mother's allele first:
   X<sup>H</sup>X<sup>H</sup>,
   X<sup>h</sup>X<sup>H</sup>,  
   X<sup>H</sup>Y,
   X<sup>h</sup>Y
   </span>{% else %}{{site.space6}}{% endif %}
7. For the question above, from which parent does the hemophilic son inherit the hemophilia allele?{{site.space3}}
8. How does inactivation of an X-chromosome generate the mosaicism seen in tortoiseshell cats?{{site.space6}}
9. Do you think mosaicism affects males?{{site.space0}}

    > OBJECTIVE: Recognize that recombination results in combinations of traits that are different than those found in either parent
    >
    > OBJECTIVE: Understand how recombination can affect both linked and unlinked genes.

10. Look at the results of Morgan's experiment (Fig 15.9). In what way do his results differ from what Mendel would have predicted?{{site.space3}}
4. Based on your answer to the question above, what can you say about the chromosomal location of the traits that Mendel used in his dihybrid crosses?{{site.space3}}
5. What is genetic recombination?{{site.space3}}
6. What are 'linked genes'?{{site.space3}}
7. How did Morgan know that recombination was occurring despite the genes being located on the same chromosome (look at the bottom of Fig 15.9){{site.space3}}
8. If two genes are located on different chromosomes, what ratio of parental : recombinant offspring do we expect? Why is this the case (think of meiosis).{% if site.data.answers.rg15 %}<span class="ans"> We would expect a 1:1 ratio (ie. 50% would be recombinant). Look at Fig 13.11 in your textbook.   </span>{% else %}{{site.space3}}{% endif %}
9. What process allows recombination between genes on the same chromosome?{% if site.data.answers.rg15 %}<span class="ans">  Crossing over </span>{% else %}{{site.space3}}{% endif %}
10. Explain why genes that are located far apart on a chromosome are more likely to be recombined than genes located close together.{% if site.data.answers.rg15 %}<span class="ans"> Crossing over is more likely between two genes that are far apart on a chromosome. If two genes are next to each other (or close), then crossing over between them is unlikely, and alleles of the two genes will usually be inherited together. When the genes are distant (but still on the same chromosome), the recombination frequency will reach 50% and they will assort independently, as if they were on separate chromosomes. </span>{% else %}{{site.space3}}{% endif %}
    <!-- This next example is from Griffiths Intro to Genetic Analysis p 131 -->
10. For this question, use the attached figure. In this question, we will draw 2 genes as if they are on the same chromosome. However, *we do not know if this is true until we see results*. {% if site.data.answers.rg15 %}<span class="ans"> See the final part of this question for the final answer (distance between genes). </span>{% endif %}
    1. In *Drosophila*, one gene results in purple eyes (*pr*) rather than the wild-type red eyes (*pr<sup>+</sup>*). Another gene affects wing length (*vg*, vestigial; *vg<sup>+</sup>*, normal). Both wild-type alleles are dominant.
    2. What gametes are produced by each of 2 homozygotes listed below? Hint: Each individual produces only one type of gamete. Write your answer below and in the attached figure. (The following will help you understand the notation, which is one of the conventions used in genetics). Remember that each gamete should have one allele from each of the 2 genes.
        * A slash indicates that the alleles are a homologous pair.
        * The dot indicates that we don't know if the genes are on the same chromosome or not.
        * If we know they are on different chromosomes, we'd use a semicolon (;) instead (eg. A/a;B/B).
        * If we know they are on the same chromosome we'd write them adjacent to each other (eg. AB/aB)

        *pr*/*pr* . *vg*/*vg* &times; *pr<sup>+</sup>*/*pr<sup>+</sup>* . *vg<sup>+</sup>*/*vg<sup>+</sup>*{{site.space3}}

    3. Write the genotype of the F<sub>1</sub> dihybrid in the attached diagram.
    4. Do a testcross of the F<sub>1</sub> with a doubly homozygous recessive male to produce an F<sub>2</sub>.
        - In the diagram, arrow 'a' indicates transmission of genes from the tester. All offspring of the tester receive the same alleles from the tester.
        - Arrow 'b' indicates transmission of genes from the F<sub>1</sub> dihybrid.
        - Remember that even though they are drawn on the same chromosome, we don't know if that is true or not. Draw all possible genotypes of the offspring, assuming independent assortment.
    5. For each of the genotypes produced in F<sub>2</sub>, indicate (with a **'P'**) if it is a parental type or recombinant (indicate with an **'R'**).{{site.space3}}
    6. *If* these genes were assorting independently, what ratio of the F<sub>2</sub> genotypes would you expect? In other words, what would Mendel have predicted?{{site.space1}}
    7. After doing the experiment, you found the following numbers of offspring. Write these numbers onto your diagram.
    
       | Genotype | Number of F<sub>2</sub> |
       |:-:|-|
       |*pr<sup>+</sup>*/*pr* . *vg<sup>+</sup>*/*vg* | 1339
       |*pr*/*pr* . *vg*/*vg* | 1195 |
       |*pr<sup>+</sup>*/*pr* . *vg*/*vg* | 151 |
       |*pr*/*pr* . *vg<sup>+</sup>*/*vg* | 154 |
       | Total:   |   |

    1. What is the total number in F<sub>2</sub>?{{site.space0}}
    2. How many parental types are there? What proportion are parental?{{site.space0}}
    3. How many recombinants are there? What proportion are recombinant?{{site.space0}}
    4. What is the map distance separating these two genes?{% if site.data.answers.rg15 %}<span class="ans"> 10.7 map units     </span>{% else %}{{site.space3}}{% endif %}

    > OBJECTIVE: Understand nondisjunction and its implications for the organism
        
1. What is nondisjunction? At what phase of the life cycle does it occur?{{site.space3}}
12. Name 2 human syndromes caused by nondisjunction{{site.space0}}

    > OBJECTIVE: Recognize that imprinted genes depend on which parent they are inherited from, even though they are usually on autosomes.
        
1. What is the difference between the two heterozygous mice shown in Fig 15.17b?
14. What is an imprinted gene?{{site.space3}}

    > OBJECTIVE: Understand how organelle inheritance is different from autosomal or sex-linked inheritance
    
15. From which parent are organelle genes always inherited (several years ago, there has been a single (human) patient found where the mitochondrial genome was inherited from the other parent, but this is exceedingly rare)?{{site.space3}}
16. Draw the following pedigree: An man affected with a mitochondrial condition marries an unaffected woman what is the probability that their child will be affected?{% if site.data.answers.rg15 %}<span class="ans">  The probability is 0 because the children inherit mitochondrial genes only from the mother.  </span>{% else %}{{site.space3}}{% endif %}
17. Draw the following pedigree for a mitochondrial condition: An affected woman marries an unaffected man. What is the probability that their child is affected?{% if site.data.answers.rg15 %}<span class="ans"> Probability = 1     </span>{% else %}{{site.space1}}{% endif %}
