# Chapter 15 -- DNA

> OBJECTIVE: Describe the historical pathway and series of experiments that led to the discovery that DNA is the genetic material

1. Why did Griffith's mice die when injected with a mixture of dead pathogenic bacteria and live non-pathogenic bacteria? (this experiment is explained in the online videos){{site.space5}}
2. What was the basic conclusion from the Hershey-Chase experiment?{{site.space3}}
3. Who, and in what year, figured out the secondary structure of DNA?{{site.space0}}

    > OBJECTIVE: Describe the structure of the DNA double helix and the structure of chromosomes.

4. What are Chargaff's base-pairing rules?{{site.space1}}
4. Which bases are purines?{{site.space0}}
5. Which bases are pyrimidines?{{site.space0}}
6. Why must a purine always bind to a pyrimidine?{{site.space0}}
7. Which bases are 'complementary' to one another?{{site.space0}}
8. What were the basic conclusions from the Meselson-Stahl experiment?{{site.space5}}
9. Draw and label a diagram of a DNA monomer.{{site.space9}}
10. Draw a diagram/model of the DNA double helix that illustrates complementarity, antiparallel strands.{{site.space9}}
11. How are prokaryotic chromosomes different from eukaryotic chromosomes?{{site.space3}}

    > OBJECTIVE: Understand when DNA replication occurs and the main enzyme involved in the process.  

9. Onto which end of the DNA strand are nucleotides added? (commit this to long-term memory â€“ it will serve you well). Draw a diagram of this.{{site.space3}}
10. On page 322, your book states that DNA synthesis is bidirectional. How does this square with the previous question?{{site.space3}}
11. Why is synthesis of the leading strand different from synthesis of the lagging strand?{{site.space3}}
12. Write brief descriptions of what each enzyme or protein below does in the replication of DNA:
    * Helicase{{site.space0}}
    * single-strand binding proteins{{site.space0}}
    * topoisomerase{{site.space0}}
    * primase{{site.space0}}
    * DNA polymerase III{{site.space0}}
    * DNA polymerase I{{site.space0}}
    * Ligase{{site.space0}}
13. What role do DNA polymerase I and DNA ligase play? Why are they necessary on the lagging strand but not on the leading strand?{{site.space3}}
14. What is the difference between proofreading and mismatch repair?{{site.space3}}
15. Why is ligase required at the end of excision repair?{{site.space3}}
16. What problem does telomerase solve?{{site.space3}}
17. When in an organism's life is telomerase active? When is it inactive?{{site.space3}}
