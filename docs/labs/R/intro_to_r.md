# Introduction to R

The only file you need for this exercise can be [downloaded here](intro_to_r.Rmd).

Save that file on your computer, then load it into RStudio, as you were taught ([here](intro_to_rstudio.html#getting-started--loading-an-r-markdown-file)). Ideally, you should be saving all Rmd files into a separate directory (folder) on your computer. It's much better to do this than to open the file directly in RStudio as it is downloaded.

For this exercise, and all others from here on, you will work entirely within the R Markdown document. When you are finished, you will knit an html file and turn that in for credit.

There is also an HTML copy of that file, in its original form, [here]({{site.url}}/b40/assets/labs/intro_to_r.html). You can use this for reference if you change the Rmd file and can't knit it any more, or just as a general reference.
