# Introduction to R

The only file you need for this exercise can be [downloaded here](intro_to_r.Rmd).

Save that file on your computer, then load it into RStudio, as you were taught ([here](intro_to_rstudio.html)).

For this exercise, and all others from here on, you will work entirely within the R Markdown document. When you are finished, you will knit an html file and turn that in for credit.
