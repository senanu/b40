## R Markdown

This is an RMarkdown document and is the file type in which we will do our data analysis in this class. This file uses a build-in dataset ("cars") which contains data of the stopping distance of cars traveling at various speeds. R can summarize the data:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r carsPlot, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

## Assignment

This assignment is very simple. You just need to change the name on line 3 and ‘knit’ this file according to the instructions in the lab manual.
