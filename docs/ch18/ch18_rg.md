# Chapter 18 -- Gene Regulation in eukaryotes

> OBJECTIVE: Describe how cells benefit from regulating gene expression

1. Under what conditions might a bacterium benefit from using transcriptional control of gene expression rather than translational or post-translational control?{{site.space3}}
2. Under what conditions might a bacterium benefit from using post-translational control of gene expression?{{site.space3}}
3. Look at Fig 18.2. Which type of control do you think can be carried out faster, feedback inhibition of an enzyme, or regulation of the expression of a gene? Why?{{site.space3}}

    > OBJECTIVE: Understand the lac, trp, and ara operons and how they serve as a model for how we understand transcriptional regulation.

1. Under what conditions would the cell 'want' to turn ON the trp operon?{{site.space3}}
2. What molecule does tryptophan bind to?{{site.space3}}
3. What happens to transcription in the presence of tryptophan?{{site.space3}}
4. Why is this an example of negative control of gene expression?{{site.space3}}
5. Under what conditions would the cell 'want' to turn ON the lac operon?{{site.space3}}
6. Describe what happens in the absence of lactose.{{site.space3}}
7. Describe what happens in the presence of lactose.{{site.space3}}
8. Why is this an example of negative control of gene expression?{{site.space3}}
9. Why would a cell 'want' to shut off the lac operon in the presence of glucose?{{site.space3}}
10. The presence of what molecule stimulates the production of cyclic AMP (cAMP)?{{site.space3}}
11. What happens in the presence of glucose? What is the final result (in terms of gene regulation)?{{site.space3}}
12. In the presence of glucose, cAMP is _____________(increased/decreased). This prevents cAMP receptor protein (CRP) from binding to the DNA, causing transcription to stop. Describe the sequence of events that happen when glucose is absent (and lactose is present){{site.space3}}

    > For each of the operons (lac, ara, trp), understand how modifications to the gene would affect the activity of the cell

7. How would the cell change (in terms of its ability to metabolize lactose) if there was:

    A. A frameshift mutation in LacI{{site.space3}}
    B. A frameshift mutation in LacZ{{site.space3}}

# Regulation in Eukaryotes

> OBJECTIVE: Describe the role of chromatin in controlling gene expression
> OBJECTIVE: Understand the effects of methylation, acetylation, and chromatin remodeling on transcription

1. What do you understand by the term “differential gene expression”?{{site.space3}}
2. Describe how DNA is ‘packaged’ in eukaryotic cells.{{site.space3}}
3. Do enzymes operate on condensed or decondensed chromatin more readily? Why?{{site.space3}}
4. What is chromatin?{{site.space3}}
2. How does the physical state of chromatin determine whether a gene gets transcribed?{{site.space3}}
3. How does histone acetylation affect transcription?{{site.space3}}
4. How does methylation of histones affect transcription?{{site.space3}}
5. How does methylation of DNA affect transcription?{{site.space3}}
6. Draw a diagram of a gene showing the promotor, proximal and distal control elements?{{site.space3}}
7. What is the difference between general and specific transcription factors?{{site.space3}}
8. What is an enhancer? Describe the model by which enhancers affect transcription, even though they may be far from the promotor.{{site.space3}}
9. What do transcription factors do?{{site.space3}}
10. How do eukaryotes control the expression of many genes at once?{{site.space3}}
11. List 3 ways in which the cell can control gene expression after transcription. For each, give a brief description of how that method affects the proteins produced.{{site.space3}}

    > OBJECTIVE: Understand that eukaryotic genes may have proximal and distal control elements
    > OBJECTIVE: Understand that transcription factors bind DNA to enhance or silence transcription

        
10. Transcription factor is a general term for molecules that bind directly to DNA to alter the rates of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. If they bind to enhancers, the rate of transcription is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. If they bind to DNA sequences called silencers, they are called \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
11. How do distal control elements affect a gene thousands of base pairs away?{{site.space3}}
12. How and in what way are multiple genes regulated at the same time with the same signal?{{site.space3}}

    > OBJECTIVE: Understand how alternative splicing affects gene expression
      
13. Explain how alternative splicing leads to one gene creating several or many different proteins.{{site.space3}}

    > OBJECTIVE: Understand how miRNA may alter how much of particular proteins are made
        
14. Describe 2 ways in which microRNA (miRNA) prevents translation?{{site.space3}}

    > OBJECTIVE: Describe the difference between oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes and how mutations in them can lead to cancer.
        
15. What is the normal, healthy function of a proto-oncogene?{{site.space3}}
16. How does a mutated oncogene promote cell growth and proliferation?{{site.space3}}
17. What is the normal, healthy function of a tumor suppressor such as p53?{{site.space3}}
18. How does a mutated tumor suppressor lead to cell proliferation?{{site.space3}}
