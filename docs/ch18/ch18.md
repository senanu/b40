# Gene Regulation in Prokaryotes

The reading guide is [here](ch18_rg.html)

- [ ] Regulation in prokaryotes. In this lesson, as well as teaching you about the basics of operons and regulating genes, I also suggest that you consider what would happen if particular genes acquired mutations that rendered them useless (such as a nonsense or frameshift mutations). Ask yourself what would be cell be able or unable to do if a particular function didn't work as a result of such a mutation.
