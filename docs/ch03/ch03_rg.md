# Ch 3 Reading Guide -- Water and life

> OBJECTIVE: Understand the structure of the polar covalent bonds in a molecule of water and explain how they enable water molecules to form hydrogen bonds.

1. What is the molecular formula for water? {{site.space0}}
2. Draw one molecule of water using Structural Formula format. Is this molecule bent or straight? Why? What do you think takes up space where there is no atom?{{site.space3}}
4. Review: Why is the bond between hydrogen and oxygen considered to be 'covalent'?{{site.space3}}
5. Review: Why is the bond between hydrogen and oxygen considered to be polar? Explain.{{site.space3}}
6. In your drawing of a water molecule above, identify which atom is more electronegative by labeling it with a partial negative charge.
  * What is the partial charge on the hydrogen atom? {{site.space0}}
7. Draw two molecules of water.
  * Label each polar covalent bond in both molecules.
  * Write the partial charges on all atoms involved in polar bonds.
  * Identify where one hydrogen bond could form with a dashed line. (Why isnâ€™t a solid line used?){{site.space5}}

    > OBJECTIVE: Describe how the emergent properties of water are the result of hydrogen bonding & what makes a molecule hydrophobic vs. hydrophilic.

8. List 4 main properties of water that emerge from its ability to form hydrogen bonds. Briefly explain what is meant by each.

    > Water Has Strong Cohesion/Adhesion

1. What is the difference between cohesion and adhesion?{{site.space3}}
2. If you fill a test tube (or glass) completely full of water, or put water on a penny, what shape is the top surface of the water (convex or concave)? How do you explain this?{{site.space3}}
3. If you partially fill a test tube (or glass) with water, what shape is the top surface? How do you explain this, and how is it different from the question above?{{site.space5}}
4. How does the cohesive/adhesive property of water allow it to move against gravity in the xylem of a tree?{{site.space3}}

    > Moderation of temperature by Water

1. What is the difference between thermal energy and temperature?{{site.space3}}
2. You are conducting an experiment in which you heat up a beaker of 200ml vegetable oil and a separate beaker of 200ml water on the same hotplate. You measure the temperature each minute and get the following results:

    | Time (min) | Temp Oil | Temp Water |
    |------------|----------|------------|
    | 0          | 20       | 20         |
    | 1          | 24       | 22         |
    | 2          | 29       | 25         |
    | 3          | 34       | 27         |
    | 4          | 38       | 30         |
    | 5          | 42       | 33         |
    | 6          | 47       | 35         |
    | 7          | 52       | 38         |
    | 8          | 57       | 41         |

3. Use a different color to plot these data on a graph.<img align="right" width="80%" src="{{site.url}}/b40/assets/ch03/GraphPaperSmall.svg" alt="Graph paper">
   - [ ] Decide which variable should be on each axis.
   - [ ] Label the axes
   - [ ] Include units on your axis labels
   - [ ] Use a different color for each data series
   - [ ] Use a ruler for any straight lines you are drawing
   - [ ] Make sure you graph is neat and large
   - [ ] Give the graph a title or caption
   - [x] **Make sure you do all of these things when drawing any graphs in this class, regardless of whether you are drawing them by hand or with a computer!**
4. Explain why two substances in the graph above differ in their specific heat. Make sure you explain in terms of the hydrogen bonds that exist in water but don't exist in oil.{{site.space4}}
1. Do all molecules in a container of water have the same kinetic energy?{{site.space0}}
2. Which molecules are most likely to evaporate from the surface as water vapor?{{site.space0}}
3. What happens to the average kinetic energy of the remaining molecules after evaporation?{{site.space2}}
4. What is the term we use for "average kinetic energy"? Does it go up or down as water evaporates?{{site.space3}}
5. Explain how evaporative cooling helps you maintain your body temperature on a hot day.{{site.space3}}

    > Ice floats (rather than sinks) on liquid water.

1. What happens to the density of most substances as they cool?{{site.space0}}
2. What happens to the density of water as it cools below 4&deg;C to freezing point (0&deg;C)
3. Explain how ice protects the habitat of freshwater fish.{{site.space3}}

    > Water is a versatile solvent

1. In a solution of salt and water, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is the solvent and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is the solute.
2. Fig 3.8 to explain how a large salt crystal can be dissolved by water molecules. Make sure you recognize how the polar covalent bonds in water dictate the orientation of the water molecules with respect to the ions.{{site.space5}}
3. What happens if you mix a cup of water with a cup of oil? {{site.space2}}
