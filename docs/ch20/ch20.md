# Biotechnology

- [ ] The reading guide is [here](ch20_rg.html)

- [ ] In one of my other classes, I set up a virtual lab describing how to use some of the bioinformatics and biotech tools to design an experiment to find out the genotypes of people who can and cannot taste a chemical called PTC. You are welcome to do it here, and it will help you understand various topics, including electrophoresis and PCR. For Bio 5A, please disregard any mention of turning anything in -- there is nothing to turn in for Bio 5A and this exercise is **completely optional**.

- [ ] This video describes the biotechnology topics that you need to know for this course. They are 20.1, parts of 20.2, and the genetic profiling part of 20.4.

I **strongly** encourage you to do this [simulation of PCR here](https://www.bio-rad.com/webroot/web/movies/lse/global/english/what-is-polymerase-chain-reaction/tutorial.html). It should take you less than 5 minutes.
