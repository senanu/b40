# Chapter 7.4 - 7.6 Endomembrane system and cytoskeleton

> OBJECTIVE: Understand what the differences are between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.

1. Where is DNA located in prokaryotes? in eukaryotes?{{site.space3}}
2. Describe the difference in size between a typical prokaryote and eukaryote?{{site.space3}}
3. What is the difference between cytosol and cytoplasm?{{site.space3}}
3. Imagine a cell the shape of a cube and whose length along each side is 2 units. Calculate it's surface area and volume:
    * Surface area:{{site.space2}}
    * Volume: {{site.space2}}
3. Now imagine a smaller cell of the same shape, but with length along each side of 1 unit. Calculate it's surface area and volume:
    * Surface area:{{site.space2}}
    * Volume: {{site.space2}}
3. Which of the 2 cells above has a larger ratio of surface area : volume?{{site.space3}}
6. Considering that all materials need to pass through the membranes of a cell, Why do you think the surface area : volume ratio is important for cells? What does a large surface-to-volume ratio allow a cell to do?{{site.space5}}
4. Complete the following table by filling in how each cellular component is used within cells. Put an 'X' in any box in which the structure does not exist.

> OBJECTIVE: Understand the basic functioning of the various cellular components, with emphasis on the nucleus, endomembrane system, mitochondria, chloroplasts, and the cytoskeleton.

7. What is the primary function and contents of the nucleus?{{site.space3}}
8. What is the primary function of the nucleolus? Where is it located?{{site.space3}}
9. What do ribosomes do?{{site.space3}}
11. The smooth ER is smooth because it lacks \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. It is primarily involved in the synthesis of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. The rough ER appears rough due to the presence of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, which are responsible for the production of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
12. What is the primary role of the golgi apparatus?{{site.space3}}
13. Describe the cisternal maturation model of the golgi apparatus. What are the cis and trans faces?{{site.space3}}
5. Review Figure 6.15 in your book, which shows the pathway of proteins manufactured on the ER through their journey through the ER, the Golgi apparatus, and finally being exported from the cell by a secretory vesicle. **Pulse-Chase experiments** (see figure) are one way we understand this journey. In a pulse-chase experiment, a cell is initially grown with non-radioactive amino acids. At the start of the experiment (the 'pulse'), a cell is placed in a solution with radioactive amino acids for a brief period, and then back into a normal solution of normal amino acids. During the 'chase' phase, the radioactivity is tracked through the cell as a way of seeing where the radioactive amino acids are incorporated into proteins and how those proteins travel through the cell.<img align="center" width="90%" src="{{site.url}}/b40/assets/ch06/pulse_chase.png" alt="Setup of pulse-chase experiment">
6. Using the data from such an experiment as shown in the figure, how do you know that the proteins move from the rough ER to the Golgi apparatus, and finally to the secretory vesicles in that order?{{site.space3}}
7. Estimate the amount of time the proteins spend in the Golgi apparatus. Consider when they first appear in significant quantities and when they appear in significant quantities in the step after the Golgi.{{site.space3}}
1. Peroxisomes contain digestive enzymes. Think of 2 reasons why it may be useful to keep these bound within a membrane.

    > OBJECTIVE: Recognize organelles responsible for energy processing

1. List 2 types of eukaryotes that contain chloroplasts.{{site.space0}}
2. What is the primary function of mitochondria?{{site.space3}}
3. Describe the membrane structure of mitochondria. What advantages does the cell have of having so many cristae?{{site.space3}}
4. What is the primary function of chloroplasts?{{site.space3}}
5. Look at Fig 6.18. Given what you know about pigments in plants, would you guess that the capturing of light is done in the thylakoids or the stroma?{{site.space3}}
6. In terms of surface area, how is the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast similar to the inner membrane of mitochondria?{{site.space3}}
7. Explain the endosymbiont theory of the origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts. Give 2 pieces of evidence that support this theory.{{site.space3}}
8. What type of reactions are carried out in the peroxisomes? Why is it important that peroxisomes are separated from other cellular components by a membrane?{{site.space3}}

    > OBJECTIVE: Understand how the cytoskeleton provides support and motility

9. List the three cytoskeletal components.{{site.space3}}
5. Microtubules are made up of two related proteins called \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
6. What is the difference between the (+) and (-) ends of microtubules?{{site.space3}}
7. Eukaryotic flagella and cilia differ primarily in their \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. Describe how this difference produces different axes of movement.{{site.space3}}
8. Microtubules and microfilaments both have motor proteins associated with them (Fig 6.21). Use Figures 6.24 and 6.26 to list the motor proteins associated with each.{{site.space3}}
9. Look at Fig 6.28. How do you think those proteins get into the extracellular space? {{site.space3}}
10. What are 3 types of cell junctions in animals? Which is most similar to plasmodesmata in plants?{{site.space3}}
