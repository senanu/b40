# Chapter 7.4 - 7.6 Endomembrane system and cytoskeleton

> OBJECTIVE: Understand how the cytoskeleton provides support and motility

9. List the three cytoskeletal components.{{site.space3}}
5. Microtubules are made up of two related proteins called \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
6. What is the difference between the (+) and (-) ends of microtubules?{{site.space3}}
7. Eukaryotic flagella and cilia differ primarily in their \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. Describe how this difference produces different axes of movement.{{site.space3}}
8. Microtubules and microfilaments both have motor proteins associated with them (Table 7.2). Use Figures 7.23 and 7.26 and 7.29 to list the motor proteins associated with each.{{site.space3}}
