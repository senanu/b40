# Chapter 6 -- Lipids & membranes

## Lipids

> OBJECTIVE: Describe the structure and function of different types of lipids (fats, phospholipids, & sterols).

1. Fats, also called  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ , are formed when three \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ are each joined to a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ via \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_reactions.
2. How many water molecules are “lost” during the formation of a fat?{{site.space0}}
3. Describe (or show with a diagram) the difference in structure between saturated and unsaturated fats.{{site.space6}}
1. Explain why unsaturated fats are more likely to be liquid (oils) at room temperature, and saturated fats are likely to be solid.{{site.space3}}
4. Draw a glycerol molecule. Attach 2 saturated and 1 unsaturated fatty acids to it using the appropriate linkage.{{site.space10}}

    > OBJECTIVE: Describe the structure and role of phospholipids in membranes.

1. Use a cartoon to show the difference between a triglyceride and the phospholipid you drew above.{{site.space6}}
2. Draw a diagram of a phospholipid bilayer.{{site.space6}}
3. Explain how the hydrophobic and hydrophilic structures in phospholipid molecules are important in the formation of phospholipid bilayer membranes.{{site.space3}}
4. How do you think a water molecule would interact with the inside of a phospholipid bilayer?{{site.space3}}
5. What is characteristic of all steroids?{{site.space3}}
6. What differs between steroids?{{site.space3}}

## Membranes

> OBJECTIVE: Describe the structure and function of membrane molecules, including phospholipids and proteins.

1. What does the term amphipathic mean?
2. Draw a cartoon of a phospholipid and label the two regions that make it amphipathic.
3. Describe the fluid mosaic model of membranes.
4. Assess how each of the following factors affects membrane fluidity

    | Feature                                      | Effects on fluidity | Reasons for the effect
    |----------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------
    | Phospholipids have saturated tails           | {{site.spacet4}}                    |{{site.spacet4}}
    | Phospholipids have unsaturated tails         | {{site.spacet4}}                    |{{site.spacet4}}
    | Temperature                                  | {{site.spacet4}}                    |{{site.spacet4}}
    | Cholesterol at moderate to high temperatures |  {{site.spacet4}}                   |{{site.spacet4}}
    | Cholesterol at low temperatures              | {{site.spacet4}}                    |{{site.spacet4}}

5. Look at Figure 7.6. What can you conclude about α-helices' affinity for water?{{site.space3}}
6. What is the difference between peripheral and integral proteins?{{site.space3}}

    > OBJECTIVE: Describe how substances move across lipid bilayers passively: Diffusion & Osmosis

7. Give a definition of diffusion.{{site.space3}}
8. In which direction (relative to concentration gradients) will solutes diffuse?{{site.space3}}
9. What is the meant by the term 'passive transport'? What makes it 'passive'?{{site.space3}}
10. What is osmosis? What is the relationship between osmosis and diffusion?{{site.space3}}
11. Is it possible for large, or hydrophilic molecules to passs through the membrane? What classes of molecules allow this?{{site.space3}}
12. Draw a picture of a liquid-filled bag made of semipermeable membrane in a beaker of water. The bag has a high concentration of salt within it. The water of the beaker is pure water.
  * label which solution (inside the bag or the contents of the beaker) is hypertonic
  * label which solution is hypotonic
  * indicate on your picture which direction water will move through the membrane
  * what will happen to the size of the bag after a period of time?{{site.space6}}


    | Feature | Effects on permeability | Reasons for this effect |
    |-|-|-|
    | Size of solute | Small molecules pass through membrane <br>more easily than large molecules | Small molecules are able to fit through <br>the tight spaces between the phospholipids |
    | Charge or polarity of solute  | {{site.spacet4}} | {{site.spacet4}} |
    | Saturation of fatty acids in phospholipids | {{site.spacet4}} | {{site.spacet4}} |
    | Length of fatty acid tails in phospholipids<br> | {{site.spacet4}} | {{site.spacet4}} |
    | Presense of cholesterol<br><br> | {{site.spacet4}} | {{site.spacet4}} |
    | Temperature<br><br> | {{site.spacet4}} | {{site.spacet4}} |

13. (review) Draw the structure of an amino acid in its ionized form (as it exists in the cell).{{site.space5}}
7. Do you think a lipid bilayer is permeable to amino acids? Why or Why not? {{site.space3}}

    > OBJECTIVE: Describe how substances move across lipid bilayers via active transport

13. What is meant by 'active' transport? How is it different from 'passive' transport?{{site.space3}}
14. Why doesn’t it make sense for cells to actively transport (pump) uncharged non-polar molecules across their membrane?{{site.space3}}
14. Look at figure 7.18. Sucrose is moving into the cell against its concentration gradient (ie. from low concentration to high concentration). What allows it to do this? (describe cotransport).{{site.space6}}
15. What is meant by an 'electrochemical gradient'. How is this different from a 'concentration gradient'?{{site.space3}}
15. What is the ultimate source of energy shown in figure 7.18?{{site.space3}}

    > OBJECTIVE: Describe how cells move large quantities or large materials into their interior without requiring those substanes to pass through a membrane.

16. In general, describe how cells transport materials into the cell without passing them through a membrane.{{site.space8}}

# Do the following in or after class...

1. Draw a cartoon of a single phospholipid molecule. Indicate which parts of the molecule have full or partial charges, and what those charges are (+ or -). Draw water molecules interacting with these charged regions, and show how water molecules *don't* interact with other regions.{{site.space6}}
1. Why are diffusion and osmosis both considered to be 'passive'?{{site.space3}}
1. Nerve cells (neurons) spend a lot of energy pumping Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> ions. Under normal conditions, where is there a net positive and where is there a net negative charge (inside or outside the cell)? Describe what would happen to brain function if energy stores in those cells ran critically low?{{site.space5}}
1. How is secondary active transport (cotransport) different from active transport?{{site.space3}}
