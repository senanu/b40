## A word of warning about these videos!

As you know, the following videos I posted for this course were made when we used a different textbook. Our current textbook combines two chapters from the old textbook into one, and goes into a bit less detail than the previous book. Because the videos are supplementary material for our course, I won't be updating them. Almost all the material from the two textbooks is very similar (not surprisingly), but it appears in a different order.

- [ ] This video describes the work of Mendel and what is meant by the laws of segregation and independent assortment (Ch 14.1, 14.2, & 14.3). You will also learn some basics about probability, which is an important concept in genetics!

- [ ] This video discusses the chromosomal theory of inheritance and how that relates to inheritance of sex chromosomes (X and Y in mammals and many other animals). The pedigrees will make sense after we finish section 14.6 in your current textbook.

- [ ] The video on linkage and linkage mapping (Chapter 14.5). It is an important topic that is covered in Box 14.1 of your textbook.

- [ ] This video is about inheritance patterns that look decidedly non-Mendelian. As you go through this, keep in mind that although the relationship between the phenotype and the genotype changes depending on the exact context, the underlying inheritance of alleles remains the same (Ch 14.4 & 14.5)

- [ ] Learn how to use pedigrees to assess whether a trait is inherited as a dominant or recessive (Chapter 14.6). I also discuss basic calculations for assessing the risk that an individual has (or will have) a genetic condition.
