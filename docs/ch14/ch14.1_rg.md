> * Homozygote and Heterozygote
> * Phenotype and Genotype
> * Monohybrid and Dihybrid
> * Law of segregation
> * Law of independent assortment
>
> OBJECTIVE: Describe Mendel’s Experiments


1. What question was Mendel trying to answer?{{site.space3}}
2. What were the advantages of using peas as a model organism for his genetics experiments?{{site.space3}}
3. Describe Mendel’s experiments with a single trait.{{site.space3}}
4. What did Mendel conclude from his experiment? Describe the model of inheritance Mendel developed to explain the results of his monohybrid cross experiments.{{site.space3}}

    > OBJECTIVE: Describe and Apply Mendel’s Law of Segregation

1. Describe Mendel’s Law/Principle of Segregation
6. If a plant with green peas (yy) is crossed with a true-breeding plant with yellow peas (YY):
    * What gametes does the green-pead plant produce?{% if site.data.answers.rg14 %}<span class="ans"> Only y </span>{% else %} {{site.space0}} {% endif %}
    * What gametes can the yellow-pead plant produce?{% if site.data.answers.rg14 %}<span class="ans"> Only Y </span>{% else %} {{site.space0}} {% endif %}
    * What is the genotype of the offspring (F<sub>1</sub> generation)?{% if site.data.answers.rg14 %}<span class="ans"> all Yy </span>{% else %} {{site.space0}} {% endif %}
    * What is the phenotype of the offspring (F<sub>1</sub> generation)?{% if site.data.answers.rg14 %}<span class="ans"> all Yellow </span>{% else %} {{site.space0}} {% endif %}
    * What gametes can the offspring (F<sub>1</sub> generation) produce? {% if site.data.answers.rg14 %}<span class="ans"> Y and y </span>{% else %} {{site.space0}} {% endif %}
    * Draw a Punnett square of the offspring (F<sub>2</sub> generation) of the F<sub>1</sub> generation.{% if site.data.answers.rg14 %}<span class="ans">

    |   | Y  | y  |
    |---|----|----|
    | Y | YY | Yy |
    | y | Yy | yy |

    </ans>{% else %} {{site.space3}} {% endif %}
3. For a gene with dominant allele (A) and recessive allele (a), what proportions of the offspring from an AA x Aa cross are expected to be:
    * homozygous dominant{{site.space0}}
    * homozygous recessive{{site.space0}}
    * heterozygous? {{site.space0}}
4. If a cat has a long tail (the dominant phenotype), design an experiment to determine if the cat is heterozygous or homozygous.{{site.space3}}

    > OBJECTIVE: Describe and Apply Mendel’s Law of Independent Assortment.

1. Which two hypotheses did Mendel test in his experiments with two traits?{{site.space3}}
2. Which Hypothesis was supported?{{site.space3}}
3. Describe Mendel’s Law/Principle of Independent Assortment.{{site.space3}}
4. Look at Figure 14.8 which is similar to Figure 13.8. **Why does the presence of 4 types of gamete in equal proportion (if the parent is RrYy) demonstrate independent assortment?** (hint – consider what offspring would be produced if there was just one chromosome, and the R and Y loci were on it such that the RrYy parent could produce only RY and ry gametes.){{site.space8}}
5. Pea Plants heterozygous for flower position (Aa) and stem length (Tt) are allowed to self-pollinate. List all the haploid gametes that could be made by an AaTt pea plant. Draw a Punnett square for this cross. How many offspring would be predicted to have terminal flowers and be dwarf? (look up which traits are dominant in table 14.2){{site.space8}}

    > OBJECTIVE: Be able to figure out what types of gametes are produced by an individual of a given genotype, and apply this to executing single and double-trait Punnett Squares.

1. Determine the types of gametes the following individuals will produce (Note: you are being asked about gametes not offspring!)
    * aa {% if site.data.answers.rg14 %}<span class="ans"> Only a </span>{% else %}{{site.space0}}{% endif %}
    * Bb {{site.space0}}
    * AA {{site.space0}}
    * AABB {{site.space0}}
    * CcDd {{site.space0}}
    * AABb {{site.space0}}
    * Aabb {{site.space0}}
    * CCDdee {{site.space0}}    
    * AaBbcc {% if site.data.answers.rg14 %}<span class="ans"> ABc, Abc, aBc, abc </span>{% else %}{{site.space0}}{% endif %}

    > OBJECTIVE: Understand the multiplication and addition rules and how they relate to Mendelian inheritance

1. If you flip 2 coins:
    * what is the probability of getting 2 heads?{% if site.data.answers.rg14 %}<span class="ans">  1/4   </span>{% else %}{{site.space0}}{% endif %}
    * What is the probability of getting 2 tails?{% if site.data.answers.rg14 %}<span class="ans">  1/4    </span>{% else %}{{site.space0}}{% endif %}
    * What is the probability of getting 1 head and one tails (in any order)?{% if site.data.answers.rg14 %}<span class="ans">  1/2    </span>{% else %}{{site.space0}}{% endif %}
2. If you flip 3 coins
    * what is the probability of getting 3 heads?{% if site.data.answers.rg14 %}<span class="ans"> 1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/8     </span>{% else %}{{site.space0}}{% endif %}
    * What is the probability of getting 3 tails?{% if site.data.answers.rg14 %}<span class="ans"> 1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/8     </span>{% else %}{{site.space0}}{% endif %}
    * What is the probability of getting at least one heads and at least one tails? (hint, there's an easy and a hard way to do this, but the easy way isn't immediately obvious. See if you can figure it out!){% if site.data.answers.rg14 %}<span class="ans"> The only way of NOT getting at least one heads and at least one tails is to either get all heads or all tails. So this is p(all heads) = 1/8 OR p(all tails) = 1/8. So the probability is 1 - (p(all heads) OR p(all tails)) = 1 - (1/8 + 1/8) = 3/4 </span>{% else %}{{site.space0}}{% endif %}
3. If both parents are heterozygotes (Aa), what is the probability that a randomly chosen sperm cell carries the allele A?{{site.space0}}
4. What is the probability that a randomly chosen egg cell carries the allele 'a'?{{site.space0}}
5. what is the probability that the offspring is AA (do this using probabilities, rather than from a Punnett square)?{{site.space0}}
6. What is the probability the offspring is aa?{{site.space0}}
7. What is the probability the offspring is Aa?{{site.space0}}
8. If an individual with genotype AaBb is selfed:
    * What is the probability the offspring is AA?{{site.space0}}
    * What is the probability the offspring is BB?{{site.space0}}
    * What is the probability the offspring is AABB?{{site.space0}}
    * What is the probability the offspring is AaBb?{{site.space0}}
    * What is the probability the offspring is a homozygote at both loci?{{site.space3}}
    * CHALLENGE: What is the probability the offspring is a heterozygote for at least one locus? (hint, think how this probability relates to problem C above).{% if site.data.answers.rg14 %}<span class="ans">  This is the same as 1-p(homozygous at all loci) so 1 - [p(AABB) OR p(aabb)] = 1 - [1/16 + 1/16] = 1 - 1/8 = 7/8    </span>{% else %}{{site.space3}}{% endif %}
9. In a cross AaBbCc x AaBbCc (assume all genes independently assort), what is the probability of producing the genotype AABBCC? Show your work.{% if site.data.answers.rg14 %}<span class="ans"> To get AABBCC, the offspring needs to be AA AND BB AND CC. So p(AA) x p(BB) x p(CC) = 1/64 </span>{% else %}{{site.space3}}{% endif %}
10. For the cross in the question above, what is the probability of producing an offspring that is homozygous at each locus? Show your work.{% if site.data.answers.rg14 %}<span class="ans"> 1/8 </span>{% else %}{{site.space6}}{% endif %}
