    > OBJECTIVE: Describe and Apply Mendel’s Law of Segregation

1. Describe Mendel’s Law/Principle of Segregation
6. If a plant with green peas (yy) is crossed with a true-breeding plant with yellow peas (YY):

4. Look at Figure 15.2 which is similar to Figure 13.11. **Why does the presence of 4 types of gamete in equal proportion (if the parent is RrYy) demonstrate independent assortment?** (hint – consider what offspring would be produced if there was just one chromosome, and the R and Y loci were on it such that the RrYy parent could produce only RY and ry gametes.){{site.space8}}
5. Pea Plants heterozygous for flower position (Aa) and stem length (Tt) are allowed to self-pollinate. List all the haploid gametes that could be made by an AaTt pea plant.
