# Chapter 19 -- Gene Regulation in Eukaryotes

> OBJECTIVE: Describe the role of chromatin in controlling gene expression
> OBJECTIVE: Understand the effects of methylation, acetylation, and chromatin remodeling on transcription

1. What do you understand by the term “differential gene expression”?{{site.space3}}
2. Describe how DNA is ‘packaged’ in eukaryotic cells.{{site.space3}}
3. Do enzymes operate on condensed or decondensed chromatin more readily? Why?{{site.space3}}
4. What is chromatin?{{site.space3}}
2. How does the physical state of chromatin determine whether a gene gets transcribed?{{site.space3}}
3. How does histone acetylation affect transcription?{{site.space3}}
4. How does methylation of histones affect transcription?{{site.space3}}
5. How does methylation of DNA affect transcription?{{site.space3}}
6. Draw a diagram of a gene showing the promotor, proximal and distal control elements?{{site.space3}}
7. What is the difference between general and specific transcription factors?{{site.space3}}
8. What is an enhancer? Describe the model by which enhancers affect transcription, even though they may be far from the promotor.{{site.space3}}
9. What do transcription factors do?{{site.space3}}
10. How do eukaryotes control the expression of many genes at once?{{site.space3}}
11. List 3 ways in which the cell can control gene expression after transcription. For each, give a brief description of how that method affects the proteins produced.{{site.space3}}

    > OBJECTIVE: Understand that eukaryotic genes may have proximal and distal control elements
    > OBJECTIVE: Understand that transcription factors bind DNA to enhance or silence transcription


10. Transcription factor is a general term for molecules that bind directly to DNA to alter the rates of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. If they bind to enhancers, the rate of transcription is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. If they bind to DNA sequences called silencers, they are called \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
11. How do distal control elements affect a gene thousands of base pairs away?{{site.space3}}
12. How and in what way are multiple genes regulated at the same time with the same signal?{{site.space3}}

    > OBJECTIVE: Understand how alternative splicing affects gene expression

13. Explain how alternative splicing leads to one gene creating several or many different proteins.{{site.space3}}

    > OBJECTIVE: Understand how miRNA may alter how much of particular proteins are made

14. Describe 2 ways in which microRNA (miRNA) prevents translation?{{site.space3}}

    > OBJECTIVE: Describe the difference between oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes and how mutations in them can lead to cancer.

15. What is the normal, healthy function of a proto-oncogene?{{site.space3}}
16. How does a mutated oncogene promote cell growth and proliferation?{{site.space3}}
17. What is the normal, healthy function of a tumor suppressor such as p53?{{site.space3}}
18. How does a mutated tumor suppressor lead to cell proliferation?{{site.space3}}
