# Chapter 8 -- Energy and Enzymes

> OBJECTIVE: Distinguish between different types of energy and describe how energy is transformed in chemical reactions.

1. Distinguish between thermal and kinetic energy.{{site.space3}}
2. How is chemical energy a form of potential energy?{{site.space3}}
3. What is a chemical reaction?{{site.space3}}
4. Explain the changes in kinetic and potential energy as a diver climbs a ladder and then dives.{{site.space3}}
5. Use your own words to describe the second law of thermodynamics. Don't use the word "entropy".{{site.space3}}
6. Given your answer about the 2nd law of thermodynamics above, how can plants, for example, get away with decreasing entropy to assemble sugar molecules from Carbon dioxide?{{site.space3}}

    > OBJECTIVE: Understand how the change in Gibbs Free Energy indicates whether a reaction will be spontaneous.
    
6. What is the definition of 'enthalpy' (*H*) (in about 4 words)?{{site.space0}}
2. What is another word for Entropy (*S*)?{{site.space0}}
3. What is Gibbs free energy (*G*)?{{site.space0}}
4. Remember that &Delta; means “change”, and for now, ignore the *T* in the equation &Delta;G = &Delta;H - T&Delta;S. Explain this using the simple definitions you wrote above.{{site.space3}}
5. Spontaneous reactions have a (positive / negative) sign of &Delta;G and are called \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
6. Non-spontaneous reactions have \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ sign of &Delta;G and are called \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
7. What is the sign on &Delta;S if entropy increases? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
8. Explain the following graph: Describe whether the reactants or products have more energy. Do the reactions require energy to be supplied or do they produce energy? Which do you expect to be spontaneous? In which reaction is entropy increased? Decreased?<img align="center" width="80%" src="{{site.url}}/b40/assets/ch08/EndergonicExergonic.png" alt="Graph of endergonic and exergonic reactiions">{{site.space6}}

    > OBJECTIVE: Explain how nonspontaneous reactions may be driven using chemical energy (e.g.  ATP) and energetic coupling (see Figure 8.10).

1. Draw a cartoon of the structure of ATP. Indicate which part hydrolyzes to form ADP.{{site.space3}}
2. What macromolecule from Chapter 5 does ATP look like?{{site.space0}}
3. The figure below is from another textbook but explains the same concept as Fig 8.10. <img align="right" width="100%" src="{{site.url}}/b40/assets/ch08/CoupledReaction.png" alt="Endergonic reaction made exergonic by coupling with ATP">
4. What is the dependent variable in this figure?{{site.space0}}
5. What is the reaction that this figure describes?{{site.space1}}
6. Is the reaction endergonic or exergonic?{{site.space0}}
7. Is the reaction spontaneous or non-spontaneous?{{site.space0}}
8. What role does ATP play here?{{site.space3}}
9. Compare the figure above with Fig 8.10. Label the (cartoon) components of the figure above as glutamic acid, ammonia, and glutamine as appropriate.
10. How does ATP help make this reaction exergonic?{{site.space3}}
11. What organelle is primarily responsible for generating ATP?{{site.space0}}
12. What is the relationship between ATP and ADP? Draw the cyclic reaction between the two. Which are endergonic and which are exergonic?{{site.space5}}

    > OBJECTIVE: Describe how enzymes speed up metabolic reactions by lowering activation energy barriers.

1. What type of molecule is an enzyme? {{site.space0}}
2. What is the function of an enzyme? {{site.space0}}
3. What is the activation energy?{{site.space3}}
4. Why do reactants have to overcome the activation energy, even if the reaction is spontaneous?{{site.space3}}
5. What types of bonds “hold” a substrate in the enzyme’s active site? DRAW a diagram that illustrates this concept. {{site.space3}}
6. What is happening in the transition state?{{site.space3}}
7. Describe how an enzyme lowers the activation energy of a reaction (see p. 156){{site.space3}}

    > OBJECTIVE: Describe the “Induced fit” model for enzyme activity and how it differs from the “Lock and Key” model.

1. What is the name of the location on the enzyme that binds the substrate?{{site.space0}}
2. Compare and contrast the “induced fit” model with the “lock and key” model of enzyme activity. In your description, describe the rigidity of the enzyme and at what stage the enzyme binds most tightly to the substrate. Which is the more modern model?{{site.space12}}

    > OBJECTIVE: Understand what conditions can change the rate of a catalyzed reaction.
    > OBJECTIVE: Connect the many factors that affect enzyme function to protein shape and the types of bonds involved.

1. Most chemical reactions happen faster at higher temperatures. What does Fig 8.17a show that contradicts this for enzymatically catalyzed reactions? Why does this happen to enzymatically catalyzed reactions but not with non-catalyzed reactions?{{site.space5}}
2. Why does changing the pH of a reaction affect its speed?{{site.space3}}
3. Why does the rate of a catalyzed reaction increase as the substrate concentration increases?{{site.space3}}
4. Look at the attached graph. Why does the rate of a catalyzed reaction plateau? (V is the reaction speed ("velocity"), S is the substrate concentration)<img align="center" width="50%" src="{{site.url}}/b40/assets/ch08/SubstConc.png" alt="Graph showing a plateau in reaction rate as enzyme gets saturated with substrate"> {{site.space3}}

    > OBJECTIVE: Use diagrams to understand the difference between competitive and allosteric inhibition.

1. Describe how competitive inhibition and allosteric inhibition work. Use a diagram to help.{{site.space8}}
2. What happens to the rate of reaction if you increase the concentration of a **competitive inhibitor**? Why? {{site.space3}}
3. What happens if you increase the substrate concentration in the presense of a **competitive inhibitor**?{{site.space3}}
4. What happens to the rate of reaction if you increase the concentration of an **allosteric inhibitor**? Why? {{site.space3}}
5. Look at Fig 8.21. What happens to the rate of isoleucine production if there is a lot of isoleucine present?{{site.space1}}
6. Do you think Enzyme 1 would be active or non-active if enzyme 3 did not function properly? Why?{{site.space3}}
7. Why do you think feedback inhibition is a good mechanism for controlling the rate at which a biological product (such as isoleucine in Fig 8.21) is produced?{{site.space3}}
