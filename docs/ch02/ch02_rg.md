2. Which atom(s) is/are more electronegative? These atoms have extra attraction for the electrons. Mark this atom(s) with a (&delta;<sup>-</sup>) to indicate that the electrons are closer to this atom(s) and it/they are therefore carrying a partial negative charge. {{site.space3}}
3. Which atom(s) are less electronegative? Mark them with a &delta;<sup>+</sup> to indicate a partial positive charge.

33. Carbon has \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ valence electrons and will therefore form \_\_\_\_\_\_ covalent bonds.
