# Ch 2.2 Reading Guide -- Water and life

If you are using the 6th edition of Freeman, please also read "How do Amino Acids link to form proteins" on p 81.

5. Review: Why is the bond between hydrogen and oxygen considered to be 'polar'? Explain.{{site.space3}}
6. In your drawing of a water molecule above, identify which atom is more electronegative by labeling it with a partial negative charge.

7. Draw two molecules of water.
  * Label each polar covalent bond in both molecules.
  * Write the partial charges on all atoms involved in polar bonds.
  * Identify where one hydrogen bond could form with a dashed line. (Why isnâ€™t a solid line used?){{site.space5}}

    > OBJECTIVE: Describe how the emergent properties of water are the result of hydrogen bonding & what makes a molecule hydrophobic vs. hydrophilic.

8. List 4 main properties of water that emerge from its ability to form hydrogen bonds. Briefly explain what is meant by each.
