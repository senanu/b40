# Chapter 9.5 -- Fermentation


> OBJECTIVE: Understand the environmental challenge that is solved by fermentation.
> OBJECTIVE: Describe the function of fermentation and when and where it occurs.

1. Some anaerobes use sulfur or other compounds as their final electron acceptor. However, these compounds are not as electronegative as Oxygen. Looking at figure 9.13, do you think such organisms could obtain as much energy as aerobic organisms from their electron transport chain? Explain why or why not?{{site.space3}}
2. Under what conditions does fermentation take place?{{site.space3}}
3. Why exactly does glycolysis cease when the electron transport chain gets ‘blocked’ up?{{site.space3}}
4. In what step of glycolysis is NAD<sup>+</sup> a reactant?{{site.space0}}
5. Explain why NADH does not get 'used up' and converted back to NAD<sup>+</sup> in the absence of the final exectron acceptor?{{site.space3}}
6. How does fermentation solve this problem and regenerate NAD<sup>+</sup>?{{site.space3}}
7. Which is more efficient in terms of ATP produced per molecule of glucose, fermentation or aerobic respiration?{{site.space0}}
8. Which is the evolutionarily older process, glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation? What evidence supports this?{{site.space3}}

    > OBJECTIVE: Understand that catabolic and anabolic pathways for fats and proteins are linked by glycolysis and the citric acid cycle

7. What is the difference between anabolism and catablolism?{{site.space3}}
8. What happens to proteins before they can enter the catabolic pathway?{{site.space3}}
9. Fatty acids join the catabolic pathway as acetyl CoA, essentially a 2 carbon compound. Consider the number of turns of the citric acid cycle to help explain why fats are such energy-rich foods.{{site.space3}}

    > OBJECTIVE: Understand how feedback regulation controls the rate of cellular respiration

10. What is the name of the enzyme that is regulated by ATP?{{site.space0}}
11. Which step of glycolysis does this happen in?{{site.space0}}
12. Is this regulation competitive or allosteric? Explain what this means.{{site.space3}}
13. What happens to the rate of ATP production if the cell has ample ATP?{{site.space3}}
