# CH 1 Reading Guide: Biological themes and scientific inquiry

## Additional Reading:

Chapter 9 of Zen and The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance

## Objective: Utilize The Properties of Life to distinguish between living organisms and non-living things.

1. Give a brief explanation of each property of life listed below. Use your own words â€“ don't copy from the textbook. A. Order

  B. Reproduction <img align="right" width="25%" src="campbell_11th.jpeg">

  C. Growth and development

  D. Evolution

  E. Processing energy

  F. Regulation

  G. Response to environment

## Objective: List and understand 5 unifying themes in biology:

Emergent Properties, Information processing, transfer of energy and matter, interactions, and Evolution.

1. Give 2 examples (not from your book) where new properties emerge at a higher level of organization. A. Example 1:

B. Example 2:

1. Explain how the structure of a leaf gives clues to what the leaf does.

2. Information in cells is contained in a molecule called **_**_**_**_**_**.

3. By themselves, genes aren't useful. Use Fig 1.8 to describe how the information in genes gets used to create something useful for the cell.

4. What do you think would happen if an organism stopped processing energy?

5. Give an example of interactions between organisms in a garden.

6. Which theme is exemplified by your growth from a single, fertilized egg?

## Objective: Understand that evolution accounts for both the unity and diversity of life and the ideas can be helpful in understanding much of biology.

1. Give a definition of Evolution (see page 11).

2. Why do you think people say that evolution explains the 'unity' (similarity) of life?

3. List the 3 domains of life. Which are prokaryotic (don't have a nucleus) and which are eukaryotic (have a nucleus)?

4. Watch the 10 minute video at about [natural selection](https://www.biointeractive.org/classroom-resources/making-fittest-natural-selection-and-adaptation). (you can also find it by googling "HHMI The Making of the Fittest: Natural Selection and Adaptation" or follow the link on the course website) 13\. What is the adaptation being disucssed? Why do the animals vary between the 2 habitats?

## Objective: Understand the scientific method and be able to form a testable hypothesis

1. In your own words, what is the difference between inductive and deductive reasoning?

2. Look at Fig 1.22\. What do you think a scientist would do if she tested hypothesis 1 and found that it was unsupported?

3. Think of 2 additional hypotheses that might explain why the desk lamp doesn't work (Fig 1.22)

4. List 3 differences between a theory and a hypothesis..

5. What do you think of the idea that "Evolutionary theory can't be trusted because it's just a theory"?
