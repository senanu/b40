# Gene expression

The reading guide for chapter 17.1-17.3 is [here](ch17.1_rg.html)

The reading guide for chapter 17.4-17.5 is [here](ch17.4_rg.html)

Please note that the the order of the videos isn't strictly aligned with the presentation of material by Campbell. They start the chapter with an overview, then go into the genetic code that is used in translating mRNA to proteins. For me, translation is the last step, so I leave it until after transcription and mRNA processing.
