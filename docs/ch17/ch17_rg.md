6. Go to the website [https://www.ensembl.org/index.html](https://www.ensembl.org/index.html)
In the search box at the top right, search for “SHANK3”. Click on the first result “SHANK3 (Human gene)” and look at the diagram of the gene. The boxes represent exons and the bent lines represent introns. Click on the red gene that is labeled “SHANK3-201 > Protein coding”. How many exons are there?{{site.space0}}
7. This map is to scale and is typical of eukaryotic genes. What does this tell you about the relative size of introns vs exons?{{site.space3}}
8. What is the main function of a spliceosome?{{site.space3}}
9. List one reason why alternative RNA splicing may lead to new proteins over evolutionary time.{{site.space3}}

    > OBJECTIVE: Be able to describe the process of translation in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells

1. In prokaryotes, the enzyme \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ travels down the length of DNA, transcribing the DNA into \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. As the transcript is made, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ attach to the mRNA transcript and start the manufacture of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. The sequence of amino acids is specified by the 3-base-pair  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. Transfer RNA molecules bring \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to the ribosome where they are attached to each other to form a polypeptide.
2. Where in the cell does translation occur in prokaryotes? In Eukaryotes?{{site.space0}}
2. What is the final outcome of translation? What does it accomplish?{{site.space3}}
3. Draw a diagram that shows the tRNA, its anticodon, the codon on the mRNA, and the amino acid that it carries.{{site.space9}}
4. Your textbook describes a tRNA molecule carrying an amino acid as being ‘charged’. It is charged both in the sense that it is carrying something, but also energetically. What enzyme is required to do this ‘charging’? Is this an exergonic or endergonic reaction? {{site.space3}}
4. How does a tRNA molecule ‘know’ which amino acid to carry?{{site.space3}}
5. How many tRNAs are there? How is it that so few tRNAs can accommodate all 61 codons on the mRNA?{{site.space3}}
6. In which direction is the mRNA read?{{site.space1}}
7. Describe how translation is initiated. Into which site (E, P, or A) on the ribosome does the tRNA bind?{{site.space3}}
8. Describe the sequence of events that leads to the elongation of the polypeptide chain.{{site.space3}}
9. What is the signal that indicates that a ribosome should stop translating?{{site.space3}}
10. In Eukaryotes, what happens after a protein has been completely translated?{{site.space3}}
11. List the two places where polypeptides are synthesized.{{site.space2}}
12. How does a ribosome 'know' that it should dock with the rough ER?{{site.space3}}

    > OBJECTIVE: Recognize the different types of DNA mutations and how they affect the final protein.

1. Transcribe and translate the following strand of DNA. This first translation will serve as a basis against which to compare other mutations.
    * Use the template strand to figure out what the mRNA should be. Make sure you transcribe it in the correct direction
    * Search for the start codon. This will set the reading frame (see definition of **frameshift mutation** on p.359)
    * Write down the amino acid coded for by the start codon.
    * Move in the 3' direction along the mRNA to the next codon.
    * Write down the next amino acid.
    * Continue until you find a **stop codon**.
