# Chapter 13 -- Meiosis and sexual life cycle

> OBJECTIVE: Understand the concept of life cycles and this relates to meiosis and mitosis.
> OBJECTIVE: Be familiar with differentiating between sister chromatids and homologous chromosomes

1. Make a sketch of the human life cycle. Make sure to label which steps involve cell division by mitosis and which involve cell division by meiosis.{{site.space6}}
2. Look at Fig 13.6. What feature (structure) of the life cycle is present in plants but not in animals?{{site.space0}}
3. What feature of the animal life cycle is not present in fungi?{{site.space0}}
4. Look at Fig 13.4. Which (sister chromatids or homologous chromosomes) are the result of DNA synthesis during S-phase?{{site.space0}}
5. Which (sister chromatids or homologous chromosomes) are the similar, but not identical?{{site.space3}}
6. Which (sister chromatids or homologous chromosomes) are inherited from different parents?{{site.space3}}
7. Draw a chromosome in its replicated and unreplicated forms. Label the centromere and sister chromatids.{{site.space3}}
8. What is a diploid cell?{{site.space3}}
9. Are your somatic cells diploid or haploid?{{site.space0}}
10. Compare a pair of homologous chromosomes with a pair of sister chromatids? In particular, what is the origin of each?{{site.space3}}

    > OBJECTIVE: Discuss the major features that differentiate meiosis and mitosis.

    For each of the features listed below, indicate if and how they occur in mitosis and meiosis
    
    | Feature | Mitosis | Meiosis |
    |-|-|-|
    | Condensation of chromosomes | Yes, sister chromatids attached | Yes, sister chromatids attached but  also synapsed with homolog  |
    | Chromosomes separated in anaphase  | (which ones?){{site.space5t2}} | (which ones in anaphase I and anaphase II?){{site.space5t2}} |
    | Nuclear envelope breaks down  | {{site.space5t2}} | {{site.space5t2}} |
    | Crossing over  | {{site.space5t2}} | {{site.space5t2}} |
    | Number of daughter cells | {{site.space5t2}} | {{site.space5t2}} |
    | Number of cell divisions |{{site.space5t2}}  | {{site.space5t2}} |
    | Haploid or diploid daughter cells | {{site.space5t2}} | {{site.space5t2}} |

1. Describe how cells in metaphase of mitosis and metaphase I of meiosis are similar and how they are different (pay attention to HOW the chromosomes are aligned and the NUMBER of chromosomes/cell).{{site.space3}}
2. Describe how cells in metaphase of mitosis and metaphase II of meiosis are similar and how they are different (pay attention to HOW the chromosomes are aligned and the NUMBER of chromosomes/cell).{{site.space3}}

    > OBJECTIVE: Describe how independent assortment and crossing over generate diversity among gametes.

1. According to Fig 13.11, how many types of gametes are possible for an organism with 2 chromosomes?{{site.space0}}
2. Which type of gamete in Fig 13.11 is most likely? {{site.space0}}
3. If the paternal copy of the long chromosome is present in a gamete, what is the likelihood that the paternal copy of the short chromosome will also be present? How does this relate to the term “independent assortment”?{{site.space0}}
4. At what stage of meiosis does crossing over occur?{{site.space0}}
5. Fig 13.11 does not show crossing over, with the result that there are 8 gametes of 4 different types. For this organism with 2 chromosomes, how many types of gamete would there be if the original cells shown in the figure divided by meiosis but included crossing over?{{site.space3}}
6. Why might asexual species be more likely to go extinct as their environment changes?{{site.space1}}
