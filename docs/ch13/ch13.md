# Meiosis and the sexual life cycle

The reading guide is [here](ch13_rg.html).

* After completing your reading, test your knowledge of mitosi and meiosis by filling in [this worksheet]({{site.url}}/b40/assets/ch13/MitosisDrawingAssignment.pdf).

* Here's a fun introduction to sexual reproduction and meiosis. One point of clarification: in this crash course video, he says that the X and Y chromosome are not homologous and want nothing to do with each other during prophase of meiosis. This is not correct. X and Y are not considered homologous because they don't contain the same genes, but they do line up with each other during prophase. Each has regions called the "pseudo-autosomal region" (PAR1 and PAR2 in humans) that does have the same DNA and the cell uses that to line the X up with the Y. In fact, there is also crossing over at these regions and the few genes within these regions are inherited like autosomal genes rather than sex-linked genes, despite being on the sex chromosomes. You can find out a lot more about it in [this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2435358/) which should be freely available.
