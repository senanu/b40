# CH 1 Reading Guide: Biological themes and scientific inquiry

> Objective: Utilize The Properties of Life to distinguish between living organisms and non-living things.

1. Give a brief explanation of each property of life listed below. Use your own words â€“ don't copy from the textbook.
    * Order {{site.space3}}
    * Reproduction {{site.space3}}
    * Growth and development {{site.space3}}
    * Evolution {{site.space3}}
    * Processing energy {{site.space3}}
    * Regulation {{site.space3}}
    * Response to environment {{site.space3}}

    > Objective: List and understand 5 unifying themes in biology:
    > Emergent Properties, Information processing, transfer of energy and matter, interactions, and Evolution.

1. Give 2 examples (not from your book) where new properties emerge at a higher level of organization.

 * Example 1: {{site.space1}}

 * Example 2: {{site.space1}}

1. Explain how the structure of a leaf gives clues to what the leaf does. {{site.space3}}

2. Information in cells is contained in a molecule called \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

3. By themselves, genes aren't useful. Use Fig 1.8 to describe how the information in genes gets used to create something useful for the cell.  {{site.space3}}

4. What do you think would happen if an organism stopped processing energy? {{site.space3}}

5. Give an example of interactions between organisms in a garden.  {{site.space3}}

6. Which theme(s) is (are) exemplified by your growth from a single, fertilized egg? {{site.space3}}

    > Objective: Understand that evolution accounts for both the unity and diversity of life and the ideas can be helpful in understanding much of biology.

1. Give a definition of Evolution (see page 11). {{site.space3}}

2. Why do you think people say that evolution explains the 'unity' (similarity) of life?  {{site.space3}}

3. What evidence do you think a biologist might use to claim that humans and mice are related? Explain. {{site.space3}}
4. Explain what is shown in Fig 1.20? {{site.space4}}
5. Use Fig 1.20 to explain why biologists say that evolution accounts for the diversity of life. {{site.space4}}

3. List the 3 domains of life. Which are prokaryotic (don't have a nucleus) and which are eukaryotic (have a nucleus)?  {{site.space3}}

4. Watch the 10 minute video about [natural selection](https://www.biointeractive.org/classroom-resources/making-fittest-natural-selection-and-adaptation).  What is the adaptation being disucssed? Why do the animals vary between the 2 habitats?  {{site.space5}}
5. What is an 'adaptation?' {{site.space3}}

    > Objective: Understand the scientific method

1. In your own words, what is the difference between inductive and deductive reasoning? (Make sure to read Chap 9 of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance for this) {{site.space4}}

2. Look at Fig 1.22. What do you think a scientist would do if she tested hypothesis 1 and found that it was unsupported? {{site.space3}}

3. Think of 2 additional hypotheses that might explain why the desk lamp doesn't work (Fig 1.22) {{site.space3}}

4. List 3 differences between a theory and a hypothesis. {{site.space3}}

5. What do you think of the idea that "Evolutionary theory can't be trusted because it's _just_ a theory"? {{site.space3}}

    > Objective: Be able to form a testable hypothesis in the form of a Research hypothesis

    A research hypothesis takes the form of **"If (hypothesis) ... and (test) ... then (prediction)"**. Although it forms a cumbersome sentence, it is useful for organizing your thoughts and making sure that an experiment you design will actually test what you want to test.

1. Use a properly formed **research hypothesis** to try to understand why your flashlight doesn't work. {{site.space5}}
2. Use a **research hypothesis** to understand why people sweat when the weather is hot. Remember that the hypothesis part is an **explanation**. {{site.space5}}
3. What kinds of hypotheses are not testable? {{site.space2}}

    > Objective: Understand the difference between dependent and independent variables

1. Sketch out a graph (include axes and labels) that shows the relationship between air temparature and time of day at your house. {{site.space10}}
1. Mark on your graph which axis is the dependent variable? Which is independent?
1. Explain your reasoning in how you knew the graph should be shaped this way. {{site.space3}}
1. Does your answer to the question above show deductive or inductive reasoning? {{site.space0}}
1. Use the other kind of reasoning to give an explanation of how you knew the graph would look like that.
