# Reading guides

In this course, you will have a "Reading Guide" to fill out for each chapter that we cover. You will be expected to turn each in, and I will give you a grade that is determined by your apparent effort. Each will be worth 3 points:
 * **3 points**: Everything, or practically everything, is complete. You have used your own words and drawn your own diagrams (as opposed to cutting and pasting).
 * **2 points**: You've done somewhat more than half of the assignment and done it reasonably carefully.
 * **1 point**: You completed less than half the reading guide or most answers appear to have been cut and pasted into the document.
 * **0 points**: You didn't do this assignment, or perhaps answered only a couple of questions.

If you don't understand something, please don't rely on me seeing comments in your reading guide, as I'll scan through them very quickly.

# How to complete reading guides

Reading guides in this course are designed to encourage (OK, 'force') you to read actively, so that you fully understand the material. The **best** way to do this, will be to print out a copy and fill it in with a pen or pencil. The second best way to do this would be to type answers in the boxes, however, note that although you can print your work, you won't be able to save it. *This is intentional*. In the past, I have found that students simply copy and paste answers from textbooks or the web, rather than trying to do the assignments thoughtfully and completely. As a result, they give up on the active learning component. Therefore, I will not provide a save-able pdf or anything like that. If you want to spend the time to make one and fill it out, that is your choice (you won't lose points for doing so but you'd probably be better off spending that time learning and understanding the material).

I will provide hard copies of reading guides, in lab on Monday, but if you ever miss lab, you can download them from this site.

Please submit reading guides on Canvas as a single PDF. It takes a long time for me to download 5 jpg images for each student.

# Printing the Guides

Even though the reading guides are web pages, I have tried to ensure that they print well. If you print the web page, you will not get the navigation bars and other stuff associated with the web page. If you find that this isn't true in your case, please let me know so I can improve it.
