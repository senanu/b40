# Ch 01 Assignment -- Themes of biology and science

Please start your work this week by:

  - [x] Printing the [reading guide](ch01_rg.html). You can fill it in as you read and watch videos. It will be due as a single .pdf file before midnight on Sunday night. Please read [this page]({{site.url}}/b40/docs/bio40.html#more-about-reading-guides) about how and why we use reading guides in this class. **Note that unless you manipulate the file, you won't be able to save work you do electronically.** I will usually provide a hard copy for you during lab. This week, however, please print your own. If you are viewing this from within a Canvas page, please right-click one of the links ([such as this one](https://senanu.github.io/b40/docs/ch01/ch01.html)) and open the page in a new browser window or tab. This will allow you to print it without the Canvas page.

  - [x] Read chapter 9 of [Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance]({{site.url}}/b40/assets/ch01/ZenAndTheArt_embedded.pdf)

  - [x] Watch the following video which I hope will encourage you to learn actively, refresh your memory often, and ultimately do well in this class.
