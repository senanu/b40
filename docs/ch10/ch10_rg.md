# Chapter 10 -- Photosynthesis

> OBJECTIVE: Explain how photosynthesis converts light energy to chemical energy and the role of chloroplasts in these processes.

1. In general, what is the purpose of photosynthesis? {{site.space3}}
2. Write the summary equation of photosynthesis from memory.{{site.space3}}
3. Indicate above which reactant becomes reduced and which becomes oxidized.{{site.space3}}
4. How does the summary equation of photosynthesis compare to the summary equation of cellular respiration?{{site.space3}}
5. Fill in the missing reactants and products into the diagram below. <img align="center" width="75%" src="{{site.url}}/b40/assets/ch10/photosynthesis_summary.png" alt="Photosynthesis summary">
1. What is the MAIN function of the light reactions?{{site.space3}}
2. What is the MAIN function of the Calvin Cycle?{{site.space3}}
3. Use Figure 10.6 and the summary equation of photosynthesis to complete the table below for the two stages (components) of photosynthesis.

    | Stage   | location          | Input molecules   | Output Molecules   | Function        |
    |---------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------|---------------- |
    | 1. {{site.space5t4}} | {{site.space5t4}} | {{site.space5t4}} | {{site.space5t4}}  | {{site.space5t4}} |
    | 2. {{site.space5t4}} | {{site.space5t4}} | {{site.space5t4}} | {{site.space5t4}}  | {{site.space5t4}} |

1. Label the Outer membrane, inner membrane, Stroma, Grana, and Thylakoid in the diagram of a chloroplast below.<img align="center" width="100%" src="{{site.url}}/b40/assets/ch10/chloroplast.png" alt="Unlabeled diagram of chloroplast">

    > OBJECTIVE: Describe the role of different pigments in photosynthesis and plant protection.
    
1. In general, what do pigment molecules do?{{site.space0}}
2. Refer to Figure 10.10. Name three different pigment types found in chloroplasts and list the colors of light each of these pigments absorbs and transmits.

    | Pigment          | Colors Absorbed  | Colors Transmitted | Main function    |
    |------------------|------------------|--------------------|------------------|
    | {{site.spacet2}} | {{site.spacet2}} | {{site.spacet2}}   | {{site.spacet2}} |
    | {{site.spacet2}} | {{site.spacet2}} | {{site.spacet2}}   | {{site.spacet2}} |

1. Look at the table you just filled in. Why isn’t green light as useful for photosynthesis as other colors?{{site.space3}}
2. Look at Fig 10.11. Are pigments proteins?{{site.space0}}

    > OBJECTIVE: Describe the sequence of events that occurs after an electron is excited by a photon.

1. What happens to electrons when the pigment absorbs light?{{site.space2}}
2. List 4 things that can happen to after an electron in chlorophyll is excited (from lecture, not all of these are in your book)
   1. {{site.space0}}
   2. {{site.space0}}
   3. {{site.space0}}
   4. {{site.space0}}
3. Describe the physical (spacial) arrangement of the light harvesting complex and the reaction center complex within the photosystem. What does the light harvesting complex accomplish with this arrangement?{{site.space3}}
4. Describe what happens to an electron once energy is passed to chlorophyll a in the reaction center? What molecule captures the electron?{{site.space3}}
5. From which molecule does P680 replace its lost electron?{{site.space0}}
6. The electron transport chain an electron moves through after being excited by PSII is responsible for producing what useful molecule? How does it do this? Compare with cellular respiration.{{site.space5}}
7. What important, high-energy molecule is produced by the electron transport chain following Photosystem I?{{site.space0}}
8. In summary, what 2 molecules are produced by the electron transport chains?{{site.space1}}
9. In what membrane are the photosystems and electron transport chains embedded?{{site.space1}}
10. On which side of this membrane are ATP and NADPH produced?{{site.space1}}
11. What is the difference between 'linear' and 'cyclic' electron flow?{{site.space3}}
12. What does cyclic electron flow accomplish?{{site.space3}}

    > OBJECTIVE: Distinguish between the Light Reactions and the Calvin Cycle
    
1. In general, what does the Calvin cycle accomplish?{{site.space3}}
2. What are the 3 inputs to the Calvin cycle? For each, list where they come from.{{site.space3}}
4. Write the name of the enzyme that catalyzes the first step of the Calvin cycle \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (It is the most abundant enzyme on the planet!).
5. What reaction does this enzyme catalyze?{{site.space1}}
6. The Calvin cycle produces G3P (not glucose). Where have we seen G3P before? (Hint: look at figure 9.9).{{site.space2}}

    > OBJECTIVE: Explain how photorespiration ‘undoes’ photosynthesis.

7. Why does the fact that rubisco binds O<sub>2</sub> a problem for plants?{{site.space3}}
8. What are the products of photorespiration? Why might plants want to avoid photorespiration?{{site.space3}}
9. Under what conditions is photorespiration a problem?{{site.space3}}
10. Look at the cross-section of a leaf below. Describe what happens in order for photorespiration to be a problem. In particular, think about the stoma and why it may be open or closed.<img align="center" width="75%" src="{{site.url}}/b40/assets/ch10/leaf.png" alt="Cross-section of leaf">{{site.space3}}
11. In addition to carbon dioxide and oxygen, what other molecule moves through stomata? What does the plant do to reduce loss of this molecule?{{site.space3}}

    > OBJECTIVE: Describe photosynthesis in C<sub>4</sub> and CAM plants. Relate these alternative modes of photosynthesis to environmental challenges and to physiological modifications in these plants.

1. Replace figure 10.20 in Campbell with this figure. It is much better because it shows the dense packing of mesophyll cells around the bundle sheath cells. This dense packing (called Kranz anatomy) prevents bundle sheath cells from contacting the air in the spaces of the leaf. <img align="center" width="50%" src="{{site.url}}/b40/assets/ch10/kranz.png" alt="Kranz anatomy of leaf">
2. Describe how C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis reduces photorespiration.{{site.space3}}
3. When do normal (C<sub>3</sub>) plants have their stomata open?{{site.space0}}
4. Why would this be a problem for desert plants?{{site.space3}}
5. When do CAM plants have their stomata open?{{site.space0}}
6. Compare C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis with CAM photosynthesis. How are the similar? How are they different?{{site.space6}}
