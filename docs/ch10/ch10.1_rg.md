# Chapter 10.1-10.3 -- Photosynthesis: light and light reactions

> OBJECTIVE: Explain how photosynthesis converts light energy to chemical energy and the role of chloroplasts in these processes.

1. In general, what is the purpose of photosynthesis? {{site.space3}}
2. Write the summary equation of photosynthesis from memory.{{site.space3}}
3. Indicate above which reactant becomes reduced and which becomes oxidized.{{site.space3}}
4. How does the summary equation of photosynthesis compare to the summary equation of cellular respiration?{{site.space3}}
5. Fill in the missing reactants and products into the diagram below. <img align="center" width="75%" src="{{site.url}}/b40/assets/ch10/photosynthesis_summary.png" alt="Photosynthesis summary">
1. What is the MAIN function of the light reactions?{{site.space3}}
2. What is the MAIN function of the Calvin Cycle?{{site.space3}}
3. Use Figure 10.6 and the summary equation of photosynthesis to complete the table below for the two stages (components) of photosynthesis.

    | Stage   | location          | Input molecules   | Output Molecules   | Function        |
    |---------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------|---------------- |
    | 1. {{site.space5t4}} | {{site.space5t4}} | {{site.space5t4}} | {{site.space5t4}}  | {{site.space5t4}} |
    | 2. {{site.space5t4}} | {{site.space5t4}} | {{site.space5t4}} | {{site.space5t4}}  | {{site.space5t4}} |

1. Label the Outer membrane, inner membrane, Stroma, Grana, and Thylakoid in the diagram of a chloroplast below.<img align="center" width="100%" src="{{site.url}}/b40/assets/ch10/chloroplast.png" alt="Unlabeled diagram of chloroplast">

    > OBJECTIVE: Describe the role of different pigments in photosynthesis and plant protection.

1. In general, what do pigment molecules do?{{site.space0}}
2. Refer to Figure 10.10. Name three different pigment types found in chloroplasts and list the colors of light each of these pigments absorbs and transmits.

    | Pigment          | Colors Absorbed  | Colors Transmitted | Main function    |
    |------------------|------------------|--------------------|------------------|
    | {{site.spacet2}} | {{site.spacet2}} | {{site.spacet2}}   | {{site.spacet2}} |

1. Look at the table you just filled in. Why isnâ€™t green light as useful for photosynthesis as other colors?{{site.space3}}
2. Look at Fig 10.11. Are pigments proteins?{{site.space0}}

    > OBJECTIVE: Describe the sequence of events that occurs after an electron is excited by a photon.

1. What happens to electrons when the pigment absorbs light?{{site.space2}}
2. List 4 things that can happen to after an electron in chlorophyll is excited (from lecture, not all of these are in your book)
   1. {{site.space0}}
   2. {{site.space0}}
   3. {{site.space0}}
   4. {{site.space0}}
3. Describe the physical (spacial) arrangement of the light harvesting complex and the reaction center complex within the photosystem. What does the light harvesting complex accomplish with this arrangement?{{site.space3}}
4. Describe what happens to an electron once energy is passed to chlorophyll a in the reaction center? What molecule captures the electron?{{site.space3}}
5. From which molecule does P680 replace its lost electron?{{site.space0}}
6. The electron transport chain an electron moves through after being excited by PSII is responsible for producing what useful molecule? How does it do this? Compare with cellular respiration.{{site.space5}}
7. What important, high-energy molecule is produced by the electron transport chain following Photosystem I?{{site.space0}}
8. In summary, what 2 molecules are produced by the electron transport chains?{{site.space1}}
9. In what membrane are the photosystems and electron transport chains embedded?{{site.space1}}
10. On which side of this membrane are ATP and NADPH produced?{{site.space1}}
11. What is the difference between 'linear' and 'cyclic' electron flow?{{site.space3}}
12. What does cyclic electron flow accomplish?{{site.space3}}
